<hi! today I'm gonna teach you on how to make a raycaster in mlog.

1. make a moving player/camera -
it's easy tbh if you know. If the controller is moving the joystick/controller, make it so that it moves the camera/player around. now
how to move that player is you find the direction of where the controller or the handle of the joystick us going and add that by speed. find tutorials on YouTube.

2. make a ray swiveling -
first you need a field of view it fov. then calculate minfov by flipping it around or negating it.
make a ray that swivels from minfov to fov. if you want, add quality. divide your screenwidth by quality, quality is manually set up by you for preferences, your screenwidth is your max quality. now, get the player/camera angle and add that to the ray swiveling.
formula: 
NewAngle = playerAng + swiveled
5n5
3. make walls -
teqnically, it's hard. but if you are using dda, this might be easy.
I use electricgun100's wall technique which from 1 variable theres jumps. if the var is 1, 
set the beginning x and y and end x and y to set 1. just like an array. easy to use. we will countinue this later.

3. midpoint -
t = 
(x1-x3)*(y3-y4)-(y1-y3)*(x3-x4)
               /
(x1-x2)*(y3-y4)-(y1-y2)*(x3-x4)

u = 
(x1-x2)*(y1-y3)-(y1-y2)*(x1-x3)
               /
(x1-x2)*(y3-y4)-(y1-y2)*(x3-x4)
U1 = u * -1

midx = (x1 + t*(x2-x1))
midy = (y1 + t*(y2-y1))

midx and midy are the midpoints
x1 and y1 is player x and y
X2 and y2 are 
X2 = x1 + NewAngle
y2 = y1 + NewAngle
X3 and y3 are the beginning of the wall
X4 and y4 are the end of the wall 
now we need to find the distance  
between the player and the midpoint
it's at number 4

4. distance -
we calculate this by 
Nmidx = midx - 88
Nmidy = midy - 88
distance = Len(Nmidx, Nmidy)
yeah right

5. W A L L S -
so in a different wall, we uhm 
draw it by wait 

so 
walla = 500 / correct distance 
wallb = walla * -1
walla2 = walla + 88
wallb2 = wallb + 88

to clear things up, 88 is the middle of the displaywidth or it half because it is 176 x 176. 500 is example distance or example wall distance. player with it.

5. FIND YOUR X
well 

The Mapping Part
x = (NewAngle + FOV) / angle_increment_per_x
angle_increment_per_x = (FOV*2) / (screen_width - 1) = 110 / 175

Simplified
x = (NewAngle + 55) * 175 / 110

so 110 came from fov*2 and fov is 55
175 came from screenwidth - 1 or 176 -1
newAngle at num 2

now it is synced!

dundundundun

now render wall if 0<t<1 and 0<U1<1 
if not skip render and and draw wall only not clear ok? if x is at 176 or high then clear

6. wall correction
today we'll use perspective correction 
Correct distance =  playerAng - NewAngle 
remember NewAngle is the rayAng



there you have it
